# General Introduction
This is a project which enables users to create,read,update and delete some items on a table in a database.
This project is based on Spring Boot. Using this project requires users to install SQLyog and Postman.
This project is a complete back-end project. No front-end part, so Postman will serve as a front-end.
By the way, this is my very first Java project in my life. So it means a lot.
