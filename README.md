# General Introduction
This is a project which enables users to create,read,update and delete some items on a table in a database.
This project is based on Spring Boot. Using this project requires users to install webyogSQLyog and Postman.
This project is a complete back-end project. No front-end part, so Postman will serve as a front-end.
By the way, this is my very first Java project in my life. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to Shenzhen Cloudta Internet of Things Technology Corporation Limited, my boss Mr. Sun, and my mentor Mr. An. I wouldn't have done this without your strong support.
